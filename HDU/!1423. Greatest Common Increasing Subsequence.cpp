Problem Description
This is a problem from ZOJ 2432.To make it easyer,you just need output the length of the subsequence.
 

Input
Each sequence is described with M - its length (1 <= M <= 500) and M integer numbers Ai (-2^31 <= Ai < 2^31) - the sequence itself.
 

Output
output print L - the length of the greatest common increasing subsequence of both sequences.
 

Sample Input
1

1 4 2 5 -12
4
-12 1 2 4
 

Sample Output
