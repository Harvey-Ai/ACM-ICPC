Problem Description
John is the only priest in his town. October 26th is the John's busiest day in a year because there is an old legend in the town that the couple who get married on that day will be forever blessed by the God of Love. This year N couples plan to get married on the blessed day. The i-th couple plan to hold their wedding from time Si to time Ti. According to the traditions in the town, there must be a special ceremony on which the couple stand before the priest and accept blessings. Moreover, this ceremony must be longer than half of the wedding time and can’t be interrupted. Could you tell John how to arrange his schedule so that he can hold all special ceremonies of all weddings?
